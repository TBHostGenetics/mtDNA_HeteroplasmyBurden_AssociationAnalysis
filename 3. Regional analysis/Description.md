**These scripts perform the following tasks:**

_1. GeneRegionAnalysis.R_
Annotates VCF files with gene region names, calculates the number of variants in each gene region and determines if there is a significant difference between two groups. 

_2. KeyGeneRegions.R_
This script was used to look at the D-loop, 12S rRNA and ND5 gene regions in more detail. It identifies the individuals with variants in these specific regions.
